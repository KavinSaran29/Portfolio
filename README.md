## Education
- B.tech CSE |SRM UNIVERSITY (_May 2027_)								       		

## Work Experience
** 12 MONTH EXPERIENCE IN PYHTON DEVOLOPING
- Uncovered and corrected missing step in production data pipeline which impacted over 70% of active accounts
- Redeveloped loan originations model which resulted in 50% improvement in model performance and saving 1 million dollars in potential losses


## Projects
### PROJECT CHECKLIST SOFTWARE

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
